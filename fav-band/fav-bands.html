        <p>Green Day is an American rock band formed in 1986 by lead vocalist and guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong and bassist Mike Dirnt. For much of the band's career, they have been a trio with drummer Tré Cool, who replaced John Kiffmeyer in 1990 prior to the recording of the band's second studio album, Kerplunk (1991).</p>

        <p>Green Day was originally part of the punk scene at the DIY 924 Gilman Street club in Berkeley, California. The band's early releases were with the independent record label Lookout! Records. In 1994, their major label debut Dookie, released through Reprise Records, became a breakout success and eventually shipped over 10 million copies in the U.S. Green Day is credited alongside fellow California punk bands including Sublime, Bad Religion, The Offspring and Rancid with popularizing mainstream interest in punk rock in the United States.</p>

      <div class="about">
        <p>Though Insomniac (1995), Nimrod (1997) and Warning (2000), did not match the success of Dookie, Insomniac and Nimrod reached double platinum and Warning achieved gold status. Green Day's seventh album, American Idiot (2004), a rock opera, found popularity with a younger generation, selling six million copies in the U.S. 21st Century Breakdown was released in 2009 and achieved the band's best chart performance. It was followed by a trilogy of albums, ¡Uno!, ¡Dos! and ¡Tré!, released in September, November and December 2012 respectively. Green Day's twelfth studio album, Revolution Radio, was released on October 7, 2016 and became their third to debut at number one on the Billboard 200.</p>

        <p>Green Day has sold more than 85 million records worldwide. The group has won five Grammy Awards: Best Alternative Album for Dookie, Best Rock Album for American Idiot, Record of the Year for "Boulevard of Broken Dreams", Best Rock Album for the second time for 21st Century Breakdown and Best Musical Show Album for American Idiot: The Original Broadway Cast Recording. In 2010, a stage adaptation of American Idiot debuted on Broadway. The musical was nominated for three Tony Awards: Best Musical, Best Scenic Design and Best Lighting Design, losing only the first. In the same year, VH1 ranked Green Day 91st in its list of the "100 Greatest Artists of All Time". The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2015, their first year of eligibility.</p>

        <p>Green Day’s original intentions for their major-label debut were much dirtier: The band originally wanted to nod to diarrhea with the title Liquid Dookie. The phrase was inspired by their experiences with getting “the shits” on tour due to terrible diets. But according to their Behind the Music episode, the full title was “too gross” for their label. “We had a fecal fascination in those years,” Tré Cool said during the Ultimate Albums documentary on VH1. The band eventually settled on the shortened and equally effective Dookie to get their point across.</p>

        <p>Dookie’s colorful, chaotic cover image is, first and foremost, a nod to the trio’s Bay Area roots — the setting was modeled off Berkeley’s Telegraph Avenue, with depictions of various local characters — but the collage-like image also features a few of Green Day’s musical heroes. “The robed character that looks like the Mona Lisa is the woman on the cover of the first Black Sabbath album,” Billie Joe Armstrong revealed during the Ultimate Albums doc. “AC/DC guitarist Angus Young is in there somewhere too.”</p>

        <p>With the support of Reprise’s Rob Cavallo, the band found ways to stay true to their punk ethos while making the album. They came into the studio with a plan, choosing the studio they wanted to record in and making sure they were well prepared. They completed the album in two months. “We were ready,” Armstrong said in 2014. “We didn’t want to be one of those bands that got stuck in the studio. We heard about record labels telling bands, ‘This is what’s wrong. Make it again’ — horror stories about spending money. We were like ‘Fuck that shit. We’re going to record this and be done.</p>
